# Raspberry Pi C Four Leds

A little C program written on my Raspberry Pi to brush up on my aging C programming language knowledge, and to learn GPIO output programming in C on the Raspberry PI.  I didn't want to use a third party library, but learn how to control GPIO output manually. So I opted for the 'sysfs interface'. 

## How to clone (with GPIO sub module)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mse240966/raspberry-pi-c-fourleds.git
```

## Example

```bash
$ sudo ./fourleds
```
